# Tom Sawyer Labs - 3 Phase Motor Driver

This is our open source 3 Phase BLDC motor controller hardware.

This hardware works, but there are many little issues that need fixing.

This design was originally created for our commercial venture **Last Mile Robotics**.
The intention was always to open the source this component of the project. So here it is.

Of course this is presented without any warranty or assurance that this will work.
